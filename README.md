Scraping Emails


This was made to specifically scrape the website in question.
A lot had to be done in strings as the web does not provide any API nor json files when requested.
Could possibly have used regex to recognise the pattern of the HTML files, but I started on the string splice method and chose to stuck to it.
Would have saved much time if regex is used
